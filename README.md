# Gravman

## Ideas/todo

* scrolling levels
* apply different gravity to some objects
* try some very light, floaty objects
* try much tighter platformer-like controls
* circle platforms (won't work until fix "edge" bug)

## fix

* how left/right spped is controlled is wrong (cant jump and move)
* very edges of platforms flip gravity

## add back to Î©500

* "trigger" input method
